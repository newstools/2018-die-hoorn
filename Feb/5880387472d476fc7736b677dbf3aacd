The Agapanthus enjoy full sun or semi shade where they should be planted in well drained soil. It is important to remember that low light areas can encourage less flowering. Regular watering especially during the summer will keep these plants happy; how­ever once established they are water wise specimens. For strong leaves and exceptional flowers be sure to feed with a good compost and organic fertiliser. Small groupings make excellent focal points. They also help to attract butterflies and bees to your garden!

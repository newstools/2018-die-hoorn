IT was a huge adjustment when she moved from a school in Germany to Oudtshoorn High School three years ago, says Sofie Heller (18), her school’s top achiever in the 2017 matric examinations. “It was quite difficult initially. Everybody was speaking Afrikaans – a language I did not know, and I struggled with English as my home language subject. But the people at the school were friendly, open and curious, and I soon felt at home.”
And she loved it that she could for the first time choose her school subjects. “In Germany the school subjects are fixed with the focus on subjects like maths and ­science. I like art and chose subjects like design and visual art.” Sofie obtained an average percentage of 87,14% and six subject distinctions in German first additional language, design, visual arts, tourism, mathematical literacy and life orientation. “We were raised in Germany to be the best that we can. My parents also wanted me to get better. “They really influenced me to get things done.” Her parents are Daniela and Winfrid Perschl, who live on a farm in Touwsriver. They are also the owners of the Yotclub Guesthouse in Oudtshoorn, where Sofie lived during her high school years while she also managed the guesthouse for her parents. She plans to study Communication Design at the Cape Town Creative Academy. “I want to one day become an art director and communication design is a base for that.”

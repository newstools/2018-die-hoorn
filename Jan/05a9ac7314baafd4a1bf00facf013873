An intelligence led operation comprising the Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Unit, Oudtshoorn Crime Intelligence and local police resulted in the arrest of two suspects (aged 51 and 57) on Wednesday for dealing in dagga. According to Captain Lloyd Ramovha, spokesperson for the Hawks, the team followed up on information of a vehicle suspected to be transporting cannabis. Whilst monitoring the R62 road between Uniondale and Joubertinia, the team spotted a van towing a trailer. The vehicle was stopped and searched, resulting in the discovery of over 23 bags of dagga weighing approximately 825 kg. The confiscated dagga has an estimated street value of approximately R1,1 million.     The pair who are from Port Elizabeth were detained and their vehicle impounded. They appeared before the George Magistrate’s Court on Friday.

The first project entails the upgrade/rehabilitation of Courtenay Road from the railway bridge to York Street Circle. Phase One of this project comprises work on the outer lanes in both directions, followed by (Phase Two) a new wearing course placed over all four lanes. Project period: Early May 2018 – end July 2018 Section of one lane (about 100 m at a time) will be closed at night 18:00 – 06:00. Minimal impact during the day. Driving comfort: There may be a 30 mm road surface difference between sections completed and the existing surface during the first phase of the project. Please take care when changing lanes and under wet conditions when the Phase One road surface will be more slippery. Low profile vehicles to take extra care. Temporary bus stops will be provided when required. The George Municipality appealed to road users to be patient and exercise caution near roadworks.
